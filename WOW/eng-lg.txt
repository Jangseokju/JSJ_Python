Russia's President Vladimir Putin has signed a decree recognising two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent states.

The regions, Donetsk and Luhansk, have been controlled by Russian-backed rebels since 2014.

The decree came into effect immediately and Moscow is sending in troops to enforce the decision.

Ukraine and the West called it a violation of international law.

The US and EU announced plans to impose sanctions on Russia, with President Joe Biden saying the move "will result in catastrophic loss of life and human suffering".

Nato has warned of "serious consequences" and vowed to defend "every inch" of its territory.

The UK's defence secretary said Russia's actions amounted to an invasion.

The move comes after weeks of escalating tensions over the possibility of Russia invading Ukraine.

On Sunday, Russia ordered troops into rebel-held regions of eastern Ukraine, citing what it called "threats".

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky called for Western help, saying Moscow's actions were intended to provoke Nato.

The Kremlin says Russia has the right to defend its citizens and accuses Ukraine of seeking to retake control of the two regions by force.

Russia has also demanded that Ukraine drop its aspirations to join Nato, which Moscow sees as a threat to its security.

Tensions have been high since Ukraine's pro-Russian president was ousted in 2014, leading to Russia's annexation of Crimea and the conflict in the east.

Western countries have accused Russia of sending troops and weapons to support the rebels, a charge Moscow denies.

But the US has warned that Russia could be planning a full-scale invasion, which Moscow has dismissed as "fear-mongering".

The crisis has prompted the US and its allies to increase military aid to Ukraine, including weapons and ammunition.

Nato has also boosted its forces in Eastern Europe and urged Russia to de-escalate tensions.

The conflict in Ukraine has killed more than 14,000 people and displaced millions since it began eight years ago.

Observers fear that a new war could further destabilise the region and trigger a wider conflict between Russia and the West.
